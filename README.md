# tmsetup-command

A command to set up a new tmux session.  With an optional first argument the new
session can be named, or 'workspace' will be used.  A pre-existing session of the same name will
be attached to.

*NOT PORTABLE* due to the use of the command 'figlet'.  A stupid joke I put in and can be removed.
